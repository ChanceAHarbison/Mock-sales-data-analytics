# Mock-sales-data-analytics
# Sales Insights Dashboard Using Python, SQL, & Matplotlib

## Project Description
This project demonstrates how to use SQL, Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib to analyze sales data from an e-commerce store. It provides insights into top-selling products, monthly sales trends, and more.

## Tools Used
- Python
  - Pandas for data manipulation
  - Matplotlib for data visualization
- MySQL for querying sales data

## How to Run
1. Creat the database:
    ```
    Downlaod mySQL, and copy the Mock database code into your mySQL and run the code. A new SQL_Store database should be created.
    ```
2. Install python:
   ```
   Use whatever methode you prefer for running python code, and then copy and past the Code then run.
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
    ```
    pip install pandas
    pip install matplotlib
    ```
4. Configure the database connection in the script (`user`, `password`, `host`, `database`).
5. Run the script:
    ```
    python sales_dashboard.py
    ```

## Visualizations
- **Top Selling Products**: Bar chart showing the top 5 products by quantity sold.
- **Monthly Sales**: Line chart showing total sales by month.

## Future Improvements
- Add more advanced visualizations like customer segments and profitability analysis.
